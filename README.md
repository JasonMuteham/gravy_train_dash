### A geospatial visualisation of MP expense claims in the UK

MP expenses are a hot topic in the UK, and my MP raised eyebrows with large claims for rented accommodation, even though they live in a constituency close to Parliament. This made me wonder if the outrage was justified.

- Would combining travel and accommodation expenses provide a fair picture?

- How do MPs in distant constituencies compare? 

- Is travelling from Scotland and staying in hotels comparable to permanently renting a home in London?

- Should we assess costs per mile instead of total expenses?

The outcome? The Gravy Train. Now armed with data, the question is: How does your MP's spending compare?



Data is supplied by 

- UK Parliament [https://www.parliament.uk/]

- Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority [https://www.theipsa.org.uk/]

Over 2 million expense records form the basis of the analysis and the underlying database.

The IPSA release updates every two months, however data available for the two most recent financial years might not yet reflect the final positions for those years.

The financial period is 1st April - 31st March.

The distance to the Houses of Parliament is calculated as the distance from the Houses of parliament to the centre of a constituency.
